Title: Visual comparison of mutational processes in a set of tumor genomes
Version: 0.99.0
Description: Given a list of tumor samples and a list of signatures, after decomposition of 
            the tumor genomes into mutational signatures, preparation of the matrix  with 
            signatures as rows and columns as genomes for heatmap visualization. The package 
            contains initial functionality imported from  an existing package, important for 
            the computation of the exposures, and additional functionalities aimed to prepare 
            the data for visualization.
