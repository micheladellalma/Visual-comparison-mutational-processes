# Visual-comparison-mutational-processes
R package for visual comparison of mutational processes in a set of tumors

R package compliant with Bioconductor requirements that provide the following functionality:
For a given set of tumor genomes (defined by the somatic single nucleotide mutations from a file in the mutation position format/MPF) the package shall:
1) Determine the contributions (="exposures") of different mutational processes/signatures in the individual tumors
2) Then, the exposure vectores shall be clustered and visualized as heatmap

Expected outcome:
1) The compressed original source folder of the package
2) The built package file
